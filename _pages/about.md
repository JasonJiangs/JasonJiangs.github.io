# üó® About Me
Hello, my name is Shiyu, a master student majoring in computer science at Whiting School of Engineering, Johns Hopkins University 
advised by [Prof.Kimia Ghobadi](https://systems.jhu.edu/kimia/) and [Prof.Claus Aranha](http://conclave.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/). 
I'm current working as a full-time research assistant at [Prof.Chongzhi Zang's Lab](https://zanglab.github.io/index.htm) on computational biology.
I'm also a research assistant at [Prof.Yanjun Li's Lab](https://yanjun-li.com/index.html).

Previously I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Wenzhou-Kean University. 
During my undergrad, I was fortunate to work with [Prof.Aloysius Wong](https://wku.edu.cn/faculty/aloysius-wong/).

My research interests lie in bioinformatics, computational biology, simulation, machine learning, and AI4Science.
I also have experiences in software engineering with Java, Python, Go, and React.js.

[Simulating Disease Spread During Disaster Scenarios]()

**Shiyu Jiang**, Heejoong Kim, Fabio Henrique Tanaka, Claus Aranha, Anna Bogdanova, Kimia Ghobadi, Anton Dahbura. *The International Conference on Artificial Life*, 2023.

[Code](https://github.com/caranha/Koudou/tree/ALIFE_2023) [Talk]()

- This research aims to create a comprehensive Agent-Based Model (ABM) to simulate daily agent schedules and movements across Johns Hopkins and University of Tsukuba campuses. The model will compare scenarios related to COVID-19 spread and assess the impact of large-scale events, like earthquakes, on masking policies and disease transmission dynamics.

# üßë‚Äçüíª Software
## Web server
- [HNOXPred](https://github.com/JasonJiangs/HNOX_Pred) (**Pred**iction of **H**eme-**N**itric oxide/**OX**ygen domains): This web server predicts gas sensing H-NOX proteins from amino acid sequence.
  The software takes a single or multiple amino acid sequence and returns predicted H-NOX centers accompanied by HNOX scores scaled from 0 to 1, where 1 is closest to the mean of H-NOX proteins in HNOXPred database.
- [Agent-based Model Analysis Dashboard](https://github.com/caranha/Koudou/tree/ALIFE_2023/src/dashapp): This is a responsive analytical web tool supporting statistical, geographical, and visualization
  analysis based on the result from a multi-agent system simulating infectious disease. It allows user to upload up to three sets of 
  result data and output comparative analysis.

[//]: # (## Python/R Package)

[//]: # (- [SICER2]&#40;&#41;: This is a Python package for spatial interpolation of ChIP-enriched regions. It is a reimplementation of the SICER algorithm in Python, with a focus on improving the performance of the original SICER algorithm.)

## Research Pipeline & Model
[comment]: <> (- [Nano-plastic ML Detector]&#40;&#41;:)
- [Agent-based Model for Epidemic Simulation](https://github.com/caranha/Koudou/tree/ALIFE_2023): 
  This is an agent-based model that considers the effects of masking and large scale evacuations at the scale of 
  a large university campus and its neighborhood. This project is part of a larger effort to create a simulator that 
  considers how human mobility interacts with large scale events at a neighborhood level in the Japanese context.
- [RNA-seq & ChIP-seq Joint Analysis Pipeline](https://github.com/JasonJiangs/RNAseq-ChIPseq-Joint-Pipeline): 
  It is an extensible and modular pipeline combining RNA-seq and ChIP-seq tools for exploring transcriptional regulatory function with high-throughout data, 
  with easy configuration via YAML files and command line arguments, providing users with phase-based execution 
  flexibility and advanced modeling analysis options.
