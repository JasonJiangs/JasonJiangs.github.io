# üó® About Me
I am currently a research intern at the [Representation Learning Lab](https://github.com/westlake-repl) 
at the Westlake University working with Prof. Fajie Yuan.

Previously, I received my Master's degree in Computer Science from Johns Hopkins University and 
Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Wenzhou-Kean University. 
I did my master thesis advised by Prof. Kimia Ghobadi at [Johns Hopkins University](https://systems.jhu.edu/kimia/) on multi-agent simulation.
I was fortunate to work with Prof. Aloysius Wong's group at [Wenzhou-Kean University](https://csmt.wku.edu.cn/en/node/1777) 
where I first stepped into the field of bioinformatics. 
In addition, I developed a deep learning model for RNA-ligand interaction prediction with Prof. Yanjun Li at [University of Florida](https://yanjun-li.com/index.html) 
and later participated in developing a single-cell foundation model in Prof. Xiaojie Qiu's Lab at [Stanford University](https://www.devo-evo.com/).

I mainly work on the intersection of machine learning and biology in a broad scope. I am interested in foundation 
models and LLMs for science including single-cell, RNA, and protein, and how to use them to discover and 
interpret the biological mechanism.

Research Interests:
- Genomics
- Deep learning for Cancer Biology and Chemical Biology
- AI for Drug Discovery
