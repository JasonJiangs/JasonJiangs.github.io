# üó® About Me
Hello, my name is Shiyu, a master student majoring in computer science at Whiting School of Engineering, Johns Hopkins University 
advised by [Prof.Kimia Ghobadi](https://systems.jhu.edu/kimia/) and [Prof.Claus Aranha](http://conclave.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/). 
I'm current working as a part-time research assistant at [Prof.Chongzhi Zang's Lab](https://zanglab.github.io/index.htm) on computational biology.

Previously I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Wenzhou-Kean University. 
During my undergrad, I was fortunate to work with [Prof.Aloysius Wong](https://wku.edu.cn/faculty/aloysius-wong/).

My research interests lie in bioinformatics, computational biology, deep learning, and AI for science.
I also have experiences in software engineering with Java, Python, Go, and React.js.

[Simulating Disease Spread During Disaster Scenarios]()

**Shiyu Jiang**, Heejoong Kim, Fabio Henrique Tanaka, Claus Aranha, Anna Bogdanova, Kimia Ghobadi, Anton Dahbura. *The International Conference on Artificial Life*, 2023.

[Code](https://github.com/caranha/Koudou/tree/ALIFE_2023) [Talk]()

- This research aims to create a comprehensive Agent-Based Model (ABM) to simulate daily agent schedules and movements across Johns Hopkins and University of Tsukuba campuses. The model will compare scenarios related to COVID-19 spread and assess the impact of large-scale events, like earthquakes, on masking policies and disease transmission dynamics.

[HNOXPred: a web tool for the prediction of gas-sensing H-NOX proteins from amino acid sequence](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/38/19/4643/6673135)

**Shiyu Jiang**, Hemn Barzan Abdalla, Chuyun Bi, Yi Zhu, Xuechen Tian, Yixin Yang, Aloysius Wong. *Bioinformatics*, 2022

[Website](https://www.hnoxpred.com/)  [Code](https://github.com/JasonJiangs/HNOX_Pred)

- H-NOX proteins are gas-sensing hemoproteins found in diverse organisms ranging from bacteria to eukaryotes. HNOXPred is a webserver for the prediction of gas-sensing heme-nitric oxide/oxygen (H-NOX) proteins from amino acid sequence.
- The tool is developed by Python scripts, Flask framework and MySQL DB.
