# üó® About Me
I'm Shiyu Jiang, a master student majoring in computer science at Whiting School of Engineering, Johns Hopkins University

I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Wenzhou-Kean University. During my undergrad, I was fortunate to work with 
[Prof.Aloysius Wong](https://wku.edu.cn/faculty/aloysius-wong/) and [Prof.Zhen Shen](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~zhenshen?language=en).

I like to embrace technologies and use it to explore things. My research interests including analysis on high-throughput genomics data, 
bioinformatics, and artificial intelligence. I also have experiences in software engineering with Java, Python, Go, and React.js.

[comment]: <> (- Python Package...)

## Web server
- [HNOXPred](https://github.com/JasonJiangs/HNOX_Pred) (**Pred**iction of **H**eme-**N**itric oxide/**OX**ygen domains): This web server predicts gas sensing H-NOX proteins from amino acid sequence.
  The software takes a single or multiple amino acid sequence and returns predicted H-NOX centers accompanied by HNOX scores scaled from 0 to 1, where 1 is closest to the mean of H-NOX proteins in HNOXPred database.
- [Agent-based System Analytical Dashboard](https://github.com/caranha/Koudou/tree/ALIFE_2023/src/dashapp): This is a responsive analytical web tool supporting statistical, geographical, and visualization
  analysis based on the result from a multi-agent system simulating infectious disease. It allows user to upload up to three sets of 
  result data and output comparative analysis. 

## Full-stack
- [OfficeAdmin](https://github.com/JasonJiangs/OfficeAdmin): An office management system developed by Spring Boot, MyBatis-Plus, Redis, MySQL, etc.
- [Microservice](https://github.com/JasonJiangs/Microservice): The project implements several small scripts and microservices using Golang and its frameworks.

## Research Pipeline & Model
- [Agent-based Model for Epidemic Simulation](https://github.com/caranha/Koudou/tree/ALIFE_2023): This is an agent-based model that considers the effects of 
  masking and large scale evacuations at the scale of a large university campus and its neighborhood. This
  project is part of a larger effort to create a simulator that considers how human mobility interacts with large scale events
  at a neighborhood level in the Japanese context.
- [RNA-seq & ChIP-seq Joint Analysis Pipeline](https://github.com/JasonJiangs/RNAseq-ChIPseq-Joint-Pipeline): 
  It is an extensible and modular pipeline combining RNA-seq and ChIP-seq tools for exploring transcriptional regulatory function with high-throughout data, 
  with easy configuration via YAML files and command line arguments, providing users with phase-based execution 
  flexibility and advanced modeling analysis options.
